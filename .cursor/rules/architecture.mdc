- Prioritize fast MVP delivery, modularity, and progressive enhancement.
- Use mocks early, replace with real services modularly, avoid risky refactors.

The technology stack will include:
- Frontend: HTML5, TailwindCSS, Vite, Vanilla JS (with TypeScript), Zod, hosted on Railway.app, source on GitHub.
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS), Next.js API Routes.
- Future Layers: LLM orchestration, realtime collab, backup/export.

The development strategy is:
- Mocks First: Early features (dashboard, chatbot, etc.) use fake data/services.
- Progressive Enhancement: All pages must work without JS; JS is layered on for interactivity.
- Incremental Replacements: Replace mocks with real services in a modular way.
- Boring Tools: Use proven, simple tools unless a strong case for alternatives.
